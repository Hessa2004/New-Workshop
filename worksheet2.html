<h2> Welcome to My Site </h2>
<p> These Pages as the work of Chris Hughes </p>
<p> I am learning Computer Science at the University of Salford. I decided to study my course at Salford because:</p> 
<ol>
    <li> The staff are so friendly 
<li> It is easy to get to by train and 
<li> they use GNU/Linux( some of the time)
</li>
</ol>
<p> My course is provided by the School of Computing, Science & Engineering, which is based in the Newton Building. The Newton Building was not built recently, and would benefit from some improvements. If it were my decision I would: </p>
<ul>
<li> Improve the lighting in the second floor computer labs </li>
<li> Fix the heating! </li>
<li> Decorate the staff offices</li>
<li> Improve the building enterance</li>
</ul>
